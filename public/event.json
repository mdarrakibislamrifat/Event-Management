        "beach":"Whether or not youre actually getting married at the beach, this wedding style is all about pairing nature-inspired details (seashells, driftwood, tropical flowers, etc.) with laid-back elements to create a casual, easygoing aesthetic. If youre opting for beach wedding style, try to embody the carefree vibes that are synonymous with a seaside vacation. Beach style is also a fun excuse to try out non-traditional details, like mermaid wedding ideas, nautical details, or a modern tropical theme.",
        "tropical":"Bright colors, eye-catching details, and playful elements like citrus fruits and oversized greenery are all elements of tropical wedding stye. As we mentioned, this is a popular choice if you're getting married at the beach or having a destination wedding, but unlike classic beach wedding or nautical style, it's also much easier to recreate even if your venue isn't located near the water. This wedding style is more about the overall vibe, so make sure you have plenty of island-inspired cocktails and music ready to go! ",
        "bohemian":"This style is for the hippies (or hippies-at-heart) of the world. Bohemian wedding style is best known for flower crowns, oversized bouquets, mismatched bridesmaid dresses, and unexpected decor pieces  like giant dreamcatcher backdrops. While this style is commonly tied to outdoor venues (like a wildflower field or lush forest), its relatively versatile for indoor locations, too, such as a barn, industrial space, greenhouse, or art gallery.",
        "classic":"Classic wedding style is ideal if youre looking to evoke timeless elegance and the utmost sophistication on your wedding day. This style steers away from over-the-top trends and flashy details, opting instead for a perfectly-coordinated aesthetic with decor that is chic and refined. Achieve classic wedding style through matching centerpieces, fine china, high-end linens, and a carefully-chosen wedding color palette. Venues like historic estates, ballrooms, and country clubs are naturally suited for classic wedding style."
